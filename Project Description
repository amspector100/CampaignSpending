Overall Structure:
inputs = basic inputs, creates filepaths based off the year you put in
processing = data processing
classes has the classes

ztypecmtedonors tells you where spending came from for ztype committees
initializeArray actually adds everything together

graphcandspending graphs candidate spending.
